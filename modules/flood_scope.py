"""Regional flood scope ("region code") names, shared by the bot and the viewer.

A MeshCore client with a region set sends channel messages as TC_FLOOD, whose
transport code confines them to repeaters holding that region's key. The key is
derived from the scope *name*, so the name is the whole setting: ``west`` and
``#west`` are the same region, and everything hashes the leading-``#`` form.

``[Channels] flood_scopes`` and ``[Channels] outgoing_flood_scope_override``
are edited from the web viewer, which runs in its own process and must not
import the bot's command machinery to check a name the operator typed. So the
normalization the bot has always used, and the rules for what survives a trip
through ``config.ini``, live here and both sides call in.
